# cstring
A super simple library for c strings in web assembly

```toml
[dependencies]
cstring = "0.0.4"
```

# javascript 

I've also included a very useful es6 module for interacting with strings in web assembly memory

```javascript
import { extractCString, insertString } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/richardanaya/cstring/cstring.js";
```
